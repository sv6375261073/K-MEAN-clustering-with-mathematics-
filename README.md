# K-MEAN-clustering-with-mathematics-
This is a unsupervised Algo which makes n different cluster based on different features of samples
it calcuates distence between each sample with the centers( defined as the n clusters center ) and update their centers as the n cluster exact center 
when distence get calculated it find the minimum distence from all center of the clusters and the center of the cluster having minimum distence have to updated as the average of current center position and the center position of the sample
so at the last when centers of the clusters calculated as final 
Now we can provide new sample to get which class this sample belong
according the minimum distence between cluster said to be belonging class of sample .
